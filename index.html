  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is Map?</h2>

<p>The notion of Map has become so prevalent in all programming languages that almost everyone has some kind of exposure to it. Generically speaking, <code>Map</code> means applying a function to values which are inside some kind of structure.</p>

<p>We usually use it a lot to apply a function to a list of values e.g mapping over the values of an <code>Array or List</code> to be more specific.</p>

<p>In this post we will first see some examples of mapping in different languages and then we dive deep into it&rsquo;s internals in terms of <code>Haskell</code> and maybe finish with a better understanding of how everything fits together. Saying that lets start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this blog post, We will be talking shortly about Haskell&rsquo;s type system( which is a very broad topic, this post won&rsquo;t eve scratch the surface). I will just explain what is needed to explain <code>partial function application</code> means and how is it done in Haskell.</p>

<p>N.B. Installing Haskell is very easy with <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a>, if you are on a Mac, you can just do <code>brew install haskell-stack</code> to install Stack. Then starting the <code>repl</code> is as easy as writing <code>stack ghci</code> in your favorite terminal.</p>

<p>Haskell is a statically typed functional programming language. That means everything has a type associated with it and the compiler checks and enforce types at compile time. So there are two phases of code in Haskell one is <code>Type Level Code</code> which involves type definition, type constructors etc. Another is <code>Term Level Code</code> which is the body of the program. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you will always have to write type signatures for trivial things. Haskell has a very powerful <code>Type Inference</code> system which can infer types from untyped code, so you don&rsquo;t have to specify types of all the things but Haskell will infer them from the code and complain if types of anything doesn&rsquo;t match. It uses <code>Hindley-Milner Inference</code> algorithm( well, an extended version of it for <code>Constrained Types</code>).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is written based on the First Chapter (All you need is lambda) of the <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">HaskellBook</a> which is great book for learning Haskell. All the code examples in this post will be using Haskell but should be understandable to anyone having decent experience in any programming language.</p>

<p>Lambda calculus is a model of computation devised in the 1930s by Alanzo Church. It&rsquo;s one process for formalizing a method. Like Turing machines it formalizes the concept of effective computability, thus determining which problems or classes of problems, can be solved.
You might be thinking but thats Calculus(Math), how is it related to functional programming or programming in general. It is indeed deeply related.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why do We need View Presenters?</h2>

<p>View should be dumb, they shouldn&rsquo;t do much other than showing data to the user. So where&rsquo;s the correct place to place your view specific logic in Laravel. Like you need the gravatar url of the user to see if the user already has a gravatar set to save the user from uplaoding a new one in your site. Or maybe you save user name as two field in db, as <code>first_name</code> and <code>last_name</code>, now you need to create user&rsquo;s full name, but you also want apply the function <code>ucfirst</code> first on them. Or maybe you have users profile pic&rsquo;s filename saved in database, now you need to create profile pic url from that by concatenating the upload directory.</p>

<p>Where should we put this sorts of logic. Eloquent Model? This can seem a very tempting choice, but why should the Model handle View specific logics. Then where is the place to put this kind of things?</p>

<p>Well maybe in their own class whose only responsibility will be to do all the logic needed in view using a specific model.</p>

<p>In laravel, there&rsquo;s ins&rsquo;t any built in way to do 1-to-1 Model-Presenter mapping out of the box but it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to set up one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a weakness for ROR(Ruby on Rails) partly due the reason I am always obsessed with learning to do things in better ways for a long time. I am still a noob but I want be a very good Software Architect someday, with deep knowledge and practical experience on software design and development following all the best practices.</p>

<p>And what I have found, Rails projects are naturally more likely to follow better ways of doing things, and community is much more robust. Though the reason behind my this perception can be the fact that I started with CodeIgniter mainly and worked on some some CI projects at the early stage of my Career which were initially done by some Indian developer and they did mostly everything from controller in CodeIgniter, there were no models, not rules of where to put what. It was a pure mess. Anyway, these things pushed me towards my quest for searching for better ways of doing things, and I did some research on ROR and found the community around ROR is great. They do TDD( Test Driven Design ) and there were many great tools to help developers test their code, TDD in PHP community is gaining traction too recently. But still I see most PHP devs takes testing as optional and find excuses to not write automated tests. Projects I have worked on didn&rsquo;t have chance/scope to do TDD. I am a not-so-experienced avid follower of TDD and design patterns and wanna be good on them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In University time, I was mainly acquainted to C/CPP programming with some Java. Then to me  <code>function</code> was something special and very different than other inhabitants of the my then programming world. In that time I couldn&rsquo;t even think of passing/returning functions to other functions.</p>

<p>Then sometime at the end of 2009, while I was learning Javascript I saw different behaviors and JS seemed more liberal to me. Like I could declare functions without name, could also assign them to variables, It was like wow to me. I read about anonymous functions and IIFE( Immediately-Invoked Function Expression ) and they amazed me back then. I first learned from Hasin Hayder while working in Leevio that I can assign name of a function to a variable  and call them like any other function and could even play with their scope with <code>apply</code> and <code>call</code> <code>Prototype</code> methods.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love programming languages and trying a new one is always fun. A year or so ago I first heard the name of functional paradigm of programming. I have came across blog posts, saw people talking about functional programming in programming communities over the last year. I have seen countless veteran programmers referring <code>SICP</code> as a must read for anyone who wants to be really good in programming. When I went over to search for <code>SICP</code> found the videos of original lecture of <code>Hal Abelson</code> and I heard the name of <code>LISP</code> from him while checking the first lecture.</p>

<p>From then on I have been cherishing a desire to learn a functional language and went ahead to try learning some like <code>Haskell</code>, <code>Clojure</code> and <code>Scala</code> though couldn&rsquo;t get too far with anyone of them. But after every few months something inside me pushes me to get back to learning a functional language well and I spend several days reading blogs, trying out simple things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started working with Magento I thought moving a magento installation with lots of data from one server to another wont be easy considering the db size is very big and the codebase is not small either.</p>

<p>I was a noob at linux server&rsquo;s stuff then, I am not good at all now, but I have become better than before. And after moving several Magento installations around, creating development sandboxes from live data with large databases like 4GB+ I do think with some terminal kungfu you can pretty easily move magento from one  server to another. The method I will show will required <code>ssh</code> access to both servers.</p>
