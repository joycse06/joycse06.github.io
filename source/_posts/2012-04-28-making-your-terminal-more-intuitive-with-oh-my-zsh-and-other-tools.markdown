I have started using Terminal massively since I got my Macbook back in 2010. I used it in Ubuntu but not that much. So I have always been searching for way about how to be more productive in Terminal and at the same time make it look beautiful as pass a great amount of time everyday. So I will be sharing some of the cool things I found in the internet which made my Macbook's Terminal far better than it was before. Here is a screenshot of my current terminal window.

<a href="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/terminal.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-118 aligncenter" title="terminal" src="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/terminal-300x187.png" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>

As you can see in the screenshot it's looking pretty good(well at least to me). It has detected that the directory I am currently in is a GIT repo and I am in master branch. And the arrows you see in the prompt is batttery strength indicator. Pretty interesting Huh! I am using the some tools which made it so. They are:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Solarized Dark Ansi Theme</strong>: It's(<a title="Solarized Theme" href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized" target="_blank">link</a>) a very popular theme and have a port for many popular editors. You can it's homepage to check screenshots.</li>
	<li><strong>Adding colors</strong>: Mac's Terminal App doesn't natively support various colors for texts. But following <a title="Terminal Color" href="https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized" target="_blank">this</a>  you can add more colors into Terminal.</li>
	<li><strong>System wide Terminal</strong>: As I had to launch terminal very frequently I was searching for a solution which will allow me to fire the terminal using a keyboard Hotkey and terminal will appear above all applications. And found <a title="Total Terminal" href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/" target="_blank">Totalterminal</a> as a rescue. Now I just press CTRL(you can configure the triggering key to you preference) two times and the terminal appears immediately. And you have <a title="iTerm2" href="http://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a> as an alternative with other useful features. Try any of them and stick with the one you like.</li>
	<li><strong>oh-my-zsh</strong> : I have been using <strong>bash</strong> as my login(default) shell until I came to know about this project. Mac osx comes with a number of shells like <strong>bash</strong>, <strong>csh</strong>, <strong>tcsh</strong>, <strong>ksh</strong>, <strong>sh</strong> and <strong>zsh . </strong>And bash is the default shell which starts if you dont change it to something else. <a title="oh-my-zsh" href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank">oh-my-zsh</a> is a very popular project by Robby Russel. I has a magic one line installer found  in it's github(follow the above link) page. Some of the features I like about oh-my-zsh are more intuitive <strong>command completion</strong>, <strong>command auto correction prompts, git repo branch detection, battery strength indication and many others. </strong>I found it a month ago and never looked back. :)</li>
</ol>
So based on my experience I can say that you can try oh-my-zsh. You wont be disappointed.

If you are using Mac try the more organized write up <a title="Terminal" href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-customize-your-command-prompt/" target="_blank">here</a> on nettuts. If you are using Ubuntu check this <a title="Ubuntu" href="https://gist.github.com/1498393" target="_blank">Gist</a> on how to install oh-my-zsh in Ubuntu. :)
