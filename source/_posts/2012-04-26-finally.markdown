Ahh! Finally I have been able to take the time and patience to put things up in my domain. It's been a while since I wrote my last blog post. I have always felt the urge to write about things I am learning regularly.

But Couldn't manage time(thats bullshit ;) ) to configure things and start writing.

Anyway, I hope I will be writing regularly from now on about various things from personal matters to web development.

I am really feeling great that I finally have a home on the web. :)
