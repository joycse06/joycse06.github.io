I have been planning for a long while to move my blog to Github and use Octopress from now on. Couldn't manage time to do that. Now finally I am free from the hassle of maintaining hosting and other details and I love markdown.

From now onward this will be my new homepage and I will try to write posts regularly [ well thats a promise I always break ].

Anyway, let's see how it goes but you know what I am very happy to finally set this up. Thanks for dropping by. :)
