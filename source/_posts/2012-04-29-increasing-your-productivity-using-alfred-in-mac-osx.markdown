<p style="text-align: center;">I have been using mac for a while. For quickly Starting applications mac have a spotlight thing which we can invoke using the CMD+SPACEBAR shortcut and type anything it will search for matching applications, documents, images and it's lightning fast as mac does offline indexing of directories and files. Have a look here:<a href="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/spotlight.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-133" title="spotlight" src="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/spotlight-262x300.png" alt="" width="262" height="300" /></a></p>
I just triggered spotlight and searched for google and it has found google drive and other documents.

But if you want a fancy UI you can have a look at <a title="Quicksilver" href="http://quicksilver.en.softonic.com/mac" target="_blank">QuickSilver</a> or <a title="Alfred" href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a> . I was using quicksilver earlier until <a title="Abir" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1082449736" target="_blank">Abir</a> told me about Alfred. I immediately installed alfred and have been a happy user since then. So let's talk about some features of alfred.

You can launch apps lightening fast like spotlight. I have set up my hot key as <strong>OPTION+SPACEBAR </strong> and I can open apps very quickly. Other than opening apps Alfred offers some other convent handy things. I am going through a few of them.

<strong>Basic Calculation: </strong> We all need to do basic calculations in computer like adding numbers, doing simple number. And it's a regular thing when you are working on a pixel perfect layout where every single pixel matters. To do simple match just trigger Alfred with the hotkey mine is <strong>OPTION+SPACEBAR </strong>and start doing maths. here's how:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/alfred.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-134" title="alfred" src="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/alfred-300x112.png" alt="" width="300" height="112" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pretty neat huh!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Finding files in finder: </strong>To find a file in finder quickly you fire Alfred and in the overlay type the word '<strong>find</strong>' and alfred will understand you want it to search for files in finder then type the keyword and the search result will update instantly along with its path in HDD. You can then use arrow keys to go to the desired file and just press enter and finder will open in that directory. here's a screenshot:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/alfred_find.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-135" title="alfred_find" src="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/alfred_find-300x221.png" alt="" width="300" height="221" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Search in google: </strong>Yes. You can even search in google right from alfred window and it will fire a new tab in chrome with that keywords search result in google. You have start with <strong>google </strong>with Alfred.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/alfred_google.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-136" title="alfred_google" src="http://blog.joynag.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/alfred_google-300x82.png" alt="" width="300" height="82" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can also search on ebay, amazon, imdb, twitter, facebook, linkedin, yahoo, bing, weather and many more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just start your search in alfred with any of the following keywords</p>

google  amazon  ebay  imdb  weather  yahoo twitter facebook
<p style="text-align: left;">and many more check Alfred's help for a complete list. like for searching for a movie in IMDB named titanic you can just enter</p>

imdb titanic
<p style="text-align: left;">and it will take you right into IMDB search page with search result for <strong>titanic.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So whats the whole point? Why will you be using alfred or any alternative when you can use your precious mouse open your favorite browser, then go to google.com and type in the keyword and press enter.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From my point of view it can save you a lot of time when you are working on an important thing and need a quick google search.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So go ahead and install <a title="Alfred" href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a> it's free. :)</p>
